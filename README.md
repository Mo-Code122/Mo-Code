# About me
Hi my name is Montgomery Jackson. I am an aspiring Software Developer. It is my goal to use my GitHub as a place for my projects to be seen and collaborated with by other developers. I currently live in Seattle, WA where I am working and applying for Software Developer positions. I am prepared to do all the hardwork required to make my way into this field. ðŸ˜Š
